***Configures `zsh`, `vim` and `tmux` to Geert's liking.***

This repository holds my configuration files, which have been
heavily inspired by looking at other people's `dotfiles` repositories
across GitHub.

## Installation
To link the various configuration files into your home-directory,
type
```
make all
```
**Warning:** this will overwrite existing configuration
files in your home directory without asking for permission,
including e.g. `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zshenv`, `~/.tmux.conf`,
`~/.vimrc`, and `~/.vim`.  Proceed with caution.

## License
