***Configures `zsh`, `vim` and `tmux` to Geert's liking.***

This repository holds my configuration files, which have been
heavily inspired by looking at other people's `dotfiles` repositories.
In fact some of the sub-directories are submodules referring to
other repositories.

## Installation
To link the various configuration files into your home-directory,
type
```
make all
```
*Warning:* this will overwrite any existing configuration
files you may hold in your home directory without
asking for permission  
(including `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zshenv`, `~/.tmux.conf`,
`~/.vimrc`, `~/.vim`, etc).

## License
These files are made available under the MIT License.
Parts of this repository have originated from other MIT-licensed
repositories; consult the README files in the subdirectories
to find out more.
